# Calculator-GUI

This repository contains a Calculator GUI that was programmed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a clean and modern design.

The HTML and CSS code in this repository define the structure and styling of the calculator interface, while the JavaScript code contains the logic for performing calculations and updating the display. The calculator is efficient and able to handle a wide range of mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, square roots, and percentages.

We have tested the calculator extensively to ensure that it is reliable and accurate, and we are confident that it will provide a valuable tool for users who need to perform calculations on a regular basis. We welcome contributions and suggestions from the community to help improve the calculator's functionality and performance.
